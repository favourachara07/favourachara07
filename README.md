### 🤖 About Me

I am a **Software Engineer** with **3+ years of experience** crafting production-ready web applications, I am now bridging the gap between web applications and **AI/ML** models.

While my roots are in building responsive applications with **React.js** and **Next.js**, my current obsession lies in the mathematics and mechanics of **Neural Networks**. I don't just use models; I am passionate about understanding the architectures that drive them—from the attention mechanisms in **Transformers** and **Encoder-Decoders** , to the feature extraction layers of **CNNs** for Computer Vision.

**My Mission:** To build explainable, scalable AI systems wrapped in accessible, human-centric interfaces.

### 🧠 The AI & Deep Learning Focus

I am actively transitioning my focus toward **Computer Vision** and **AI Agentic Flows**.
* **Computer Vision (My Absolute Favorite):** I have a deep appreciation for **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. I love exploring how filters, pooling layers, and activation functions work together to enable machines to "see" and interpret visual data.
* **NLP & LLMs:** Working with **Transformers** and integrating Large Language Models into real-world applications.
* **AI Agents:** Designing autonomous workflows and agents using **n8n** to solve complex automation problems.
